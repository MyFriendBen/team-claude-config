# Find Screener Fields — Spec Mapping Workflow

Given a program `spec.md`, this skill walks through each eligibility criterion and tells you exactly which screener fields to use, which criteria have data gaps, and what assumptions to document.

---

## Step 1: Get the Spec

Ask the user:

> Please provide the `spec.md` file for the program you want to map. You can either:
> - Paste the full content directly into the chat, or
> - Give me the file path and I'll read it. Specs live in two places: a family member at
>   `benefits-api/programs/programs/cross_white_label/liheap/specs/mo.md`, a single-white-label
>   program at `benefits-api/programs/programs/white_labels/wa/hcv/spec.md`.

Read the file if a path is given. Confirm the program name, state, and white label before proceeding.

---

## Step 2: Parse the Eligibility Criteria

Extract every numbered criterion from the `## Eligibility Criteria` section of the spec. For each criterion record:

- The criterion number and plain-language summary
- Any screener fields already cited in the spec (look for `Screener fields:` lines)
- Whether the criterion is already flagged as a data gap (`⚠️ data gap`)
- Any notes or caveats the spec author included

Do not skip criteria that are already marked as data gaps — they still need a recommendation.

---

## Step 3: Map Each Criterion to Screener Fields

For each criterion, reason through the full screener field inventory below and recommend the best available fields. Apply the mapping rules that follow.

### Complete Screener Field Inventory

**Screen (household level)**

### Mapping Rules

Apply these rules when recommending fields for each criterion:

**Income tests**
- Use `calc_gross_income("monthly", ["all"])` or `calc_gross_income("yearly", ["all"])` for total gross income.
- Use `calc_gross_income(freq, ["wages", "selfEmployment"])` for earned income only.
- Use `calc_gross_income(freq, ["sSI", "sSID", "pension", ...])` to isolate unearned income types.
- Use `calc_net_income(freq, income_types, expense_types)` when the program deducts certain expense types.
- Always pair income checks with `household_size` when a Federal Poverty Level (FPL) threshold is involved.

**Asset tests**
- Use `household_assets`. Note: this is a household-level total and may include non-eligible members' assets — flag this as a potential data gap for programs that test assets per applicant or per couple only.

**Age checks**
- Use `birth_year` + `birth_month` (not `age`) for precise age calculation. `age` is deprecated.
- For programs with age ranges or cutoffs keyed to birth year (e.g., Social Security full retirement age), note that the calculator must use the birth-year schedule, not a fixed age.

**Disability**
- `disabled` = general disability
- `long_term_disability` = long-term / expected to last 12+ months — closer match for SSA definitions
- `visually_impaired` = blindness / visual impairment (relevant for programs with a separate blind threshold, e.g., SSDI SGA)
- `disability_medicaid` = specifically on Medicaid due to disability

**Current enrollment (categorical eligibility)**
- Read current benefits via `screen.has_benefit("name_abbreviated")` (e.g. `screen.has_benefit("snap")`), which reads the `CurrentBenefit` join table.
- When a program grants automatic eligibility to recipients of another program, check the relevant benefit with `has_benefit(...)`. To match *any* state variant of a benefit (e.g. `tanf` / `co_tanf` / `wa_tanf` / `ma_tafdc`), use `screen.has_base_benefit("tanf")`, which queries by `Program.base_program` instead of an exact name.
- When enrollment in a program disqualifies a person, use the same `has_benefit(...)` / `has_base_benefit(...)` call to filter them out.

**Housing**
- Use `housing_situation` for general housing type.
- Use `EnergyCalculatorScreen.is_home_owner` / `is_renter` for energy programs.
- Use `screen.has_benefit("section_8")` if the criterion involves current housing voucher status.

**Children and family structure**
- Child presence: count `HouseholdMember` records where `relationship` is `child`, `fosterChild`, or `grandChild` and age is within the program's definition of qualifying child.
- Pregnancy: `pregnant` on HouseholdMember.
- Marriage / joint filing: check for a member with `relationship` of `spouse` or `domesticPartner`.
- Guardian count: use `screen.num_guardians()`.

**Student status**
- Use `student` for basic student presence.
- Use `student_full_time` for programs that require full-time enrollment.
- Use `student_job_training_program`, `student_has_work_study`, `student_works_20_plus_hrs` for SNAP student exemptions and similar rules.

**Veterans**
- `veteran` on HouseholdMember for general veteran status.
- `EnergyCalculatorMember.surviving_spouse` for surviving-spouse-specific rules.

**Work history**
- `unemployed` = currently unemployed.
- `worked_in_last_18_mos` = employment in recent 18-month window.
- No field captures lifetime work history or Social Security work credits — always flag this as a data gap for SSDI, SSI, and similar programs.

**Insurance**
- Use the `Insurance` model fields per member for per-person insurance status.
- Use Screen-level `has_*_hi` fields when asking about the household's existing insurance rather than per-person coverage.

**Geographic eligibility**
- Use `zipcode` and `county` to establish location. The calculator typically enforces white-label matching rather than re-checking the ZIP, but cite both fields for residency criteria.

## Step 4: Identify Data Gaps

For every criterion that cannot be fully evaluated with available fields, write a data gap entry containing:

1. **What's missing** — which real-world fact the screener doesn't capture
2. **Inclusivity assumption** — the safe default (almost always: assume the person meets this criterion unless proven otherwise)
3. **Suggested improvement** — a concrete screener question that would close the gap, if one exists

Common data gaps to watch for:
- Work history / Social Security credits (no field exists)
- Whether an applicant is claimed as a dependent on another tax return (no field)
- Criminal justice / incarceration status (no field — do not suggest adding one)
- Immigration/citizenship status (no field — do not suggest adding one; flag as a data gap only)
- Whether a disability began before a specific age (no field)
- Specific medical conditions or diagnoses (no field)
- Whether income is from a Social Security-covered job (no field)
- Marital history (no field beyond current relationship status)

## Step 5: Deliver the Mapping

Present your findings in this exact structure:

---

### Program: [Program Name] ([State])

#### Criterion-by-Criterion Field Map

For each criterion:

**Criterion N — [plain-language summary]**
- **Fields to use:** list the specific field names
- **How to use them:** one sentence explaining the check (e.g., "Sum `calc_gross_income('monthly', ['all'])` and compare to the FPL table for `household_size`")
- **Data gap:** Yes / No — and if Yes, state the assumption and any suggested improvement
- **Notes:** any spec caveats worth carrying into the implementation

#### Summary Table

| Criterion | Fields | Data Gap? |
|---|---|---|
| 1. [short label] | `field_a`, `field_b` | No |
| 2. [short label] | `field_c` | Yes — assume eligible |
| ... | ... | ... |

#### Fields Not in the Screener

List any fields cited in the original spec that do not exist in the screener model (e.g., `filing_status`, `medical_condition`). For each, note:
- Whether an existing field is a reasonable proxy
- Whether the spec's data gap note already handles it
- Whether a new screener field should be proposed

#### Already-Has Check

A household can only declare it *already has* a program if that program's `show_in_has_benefits_step` flag is true (set in its `initial_config.json`) — that's the gate for whether it appears on the current-benefits step at all. Once a household has declared a benefit, that signal feeds exactly two places:

1. **A *different* program's calculator** — to model presumed eligibility or ineligibility, via `screen.has_benefit("that_other_program")` / `has_base_benefit(...)` (e.g. "presumed eligible if they already receive SNAP").
2. **The `already_has` results workflow** — to filter the **same** program out of results. This is automatic: `screener/views.py` sets the program's `already_has` flag from `screen.has_benefit(program.name_abbreviated)` and the frontend hides it. The calculator does **nothing** for this — never call `has_benefit()` on the calculator's own program name to suppress it.

So in a calculator, `has_benefit()` is only ever for case 1 (checking *another* program), never case 2.

---

## Step 6: Offer Next Steps

After delivering the mapping, ask:

> Would you like me to:
> 1. Draft the eligibility calculator method stubs with these fields wired in?
> 2. Flag which of these fields are already in the screener reference doc vs. need to be added?
> 3. Move on to a different spec?
